            <br>Take a look at this simple and good looking UI.</br>
            <br>Like always, working on HTML CSS is all about figuring out the layout and the structure.</br>
            <ul>
                <li>Divide the whole UI Into Divs (or sections if you want to use HTML5!)</li>
                <li>See how they have centred the whole layout and used border radius and shadow for styling!</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can use flexbox for the layout and positioning.</li>
                    <li>And you can select the icons from here: https://fontawesome.com/icons</li>
                </ul>
                <li>A detail that you might have missed: The colour of the bottom border is not the same as the colour of bottom navigation bar!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Try your best to create this UI and implement it in the cool stuff you make in future. Experiment with the colours, add your favourite wallpaper and make this yours! If you can, try to make the colour of the icons change on hovering using CSS!</p>
